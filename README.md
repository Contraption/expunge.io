EXPUNGE.IO
============

* ruby 2.0.0p247
* Rails 4.0.0 


###What is this?

This is a web app that helps folks with a juvenile record:
1. determine if they are eligible to petition for expungement
2. get in contact with legal aid to complete the expungement process

###What's the goal?

To provide a simple & easily share-able landing page that de-mystifies expungement, & ultimately helps more folks kick off the expungement process.

###Why?

A juvenile record makes it difficult to get a job (among other things). The good news is that juvenile records don't have to be permanent, as they can be expunged. However, while many qualify for expungement, few people actually end up petitioning. This is whack.




The idea for this app came from the awesome Juvenile Justice Council of the Mikva Challenge
