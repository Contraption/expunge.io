	<h4>This is a web app created for youth with juvenile records.</h4>
	A juvenile record makes it difficult to get a job. The good news is that juvenile records don't have to be permanent, as they can be expunged. However, only a small proportion of people who qualify for expungement end up petitioning [insert ridiculous stats here]. This app aims to educate folks about expungement and connect youth to legal aid, with the hope of getting everyone who's eligible to expunge their records to do so!

  <h4>The <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/site/epage/146561_719.htm">idea for this app</a> came from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MCJJustice">Juvenile Justice Council</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikvaChallenge">Mikva Challenge</a></h4>
